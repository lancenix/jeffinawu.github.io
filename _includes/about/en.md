Hello, the real name's Jeff (yes, I know it has a meme reference). I'm a rising junior who's majoring in Game Development. I take on a lot of interests actually; currently diving into the realm of Machine Learning and Software Development with cool projects I've got in mind. I'm also curious about UI Programming and UXE, would love to pursue a career around that area in the game industry. I'm currently working as a junior developer @ Apple Academy.

### Why Blogging?
I love narrating (not saying that I'm good at it), I talk (or rant - depending on how you see it) for hours when something really occupies my mind. Rather than mumbling to myself, I figured I should really organize them into something that's actually **readable** by other people. A good enough proof that 'I aM An EnGinEEr'. I also like doing storytelling, especially writing fanfictions (soz). Though I can be awkward when engaging in a conversation, I'll do my best to not be in this communication format though.

This is a blog of my (probably) wholesome life journey throughout my academic years (both in high school and college) / tech industries experiences as someone who grew up wanting to become an astronaut and ended up in the game industry ??? *been wondering how that happened too, actually*.

**So sit back, enjoy and hopefully you'll find these stories either funny or useful.**

(or neither, doesn't matter as long you enjoy them) ✌️
