Hello, my name's Jeff (yes, I know it has a meme reference). I'm a rising junior who's majoring in Game Development. I take on a lot of interests actually; currently diving into the realm of AI and Machine Learning with cool projects I've got in mind. I'm also curious about UI and 3D Programming, would love to pursue a career around that area in the game industry. I'm an aspiring iOS Developer and soon begin my work as a junior developer at Apple Developer Academy on March 2020. (I swear I'm going to write about my experience there).

### Why Blogging?
I love narrating (not saying that I'm good at it), I talk (or rant - depending on how you see it) for hours when something really occupies my mind. Rather than mumbling to myself, I figured I should really organize them into something that's actually **readable** by other people. A good enough proof that 'I aM An EnGinEEr'. 

This is a blog of my (probably) wholesome life journey throughout my academic years (both in high school and college) / tech industries experiences as someone who grew up wanting to become an astronaut and ended up in the game industry ??? *been wondering how that happened too, actually*. 

**So sit back, enjoy and hopefully you'll find these stories either funny or useful.** 

(or neither, doesn't matter as long you enjoy them) ‚úåÔ∏è
