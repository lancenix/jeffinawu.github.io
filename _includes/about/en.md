> "Whatever you are, be a good one." - Abraham Lincoln

Hi, my name's Jeffina. I'm a rising junior who's majoring in Game Development. I take on a lot of interests actually; currently diving into the realm of AI and Machine Learning with cool projects I've got in mind. I'm also curious about UI and 3D Programming, would love to pursue a career around that area in the game industry. I'm an aspiring iOS Developer and soon begin my work as a junior developer at Apple Developer Academy. (I swear I'm going to write posts about my experience there ü§û).

## Why Blogging?
I love telling stories (not saying that I'm good at it), but I can talk (or rant-depends on how you see it) for hours when something really occupies my mind. Rather than mumbling to myself, I figured I should really organize them into something that's actually **understandable**. A good enough proof that 'I aM an EngIneEr, I sOlve thInGs' for me.

Now this blog can head into any directions really, but I'm going to try to trim it down to just a blog of my (probably) wholesome life journey throughout my academic years / tech industries experiences as someone who grew up wanting to become an astronaut and ended up in the game industry ??? *been wondering how that happened too, actually*.

**So sit back, enjoy and hopefully you'll find these stories either funny or useful.** 
(or neither, doesn't matter as long you enjoy them) ‚úåÔ∏è
