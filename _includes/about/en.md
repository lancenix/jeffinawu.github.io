Hi, my name's Jeffina. I'm a rising junior who's majoring in Game Development. I take on a lot of interests actually; currently diving into the realm of AI and Machine Learning with cool projects I've got in mind. I'm also curious about UI and 3D Programming, would love to pursue a career around that area in the game industry 👏. I'm an aspiring iOS Developer and soon begin my work as a junior developer at Apple Academy. I swear I'm going to write posts about my experience there 🤞.
