As a general disclaimer, I have no idea how to write a **good** scientific paper. I have no idea how to do proper research. So it's really predictable for all of you to know that, yes, I'm very much stressed and feeling pressured with the fact that I have a lot of chapters to bullsh\*t through. EXCEPT, I can't really bullsh\*t them. It's an actual paper, after all.

You might be wondering. *Then why??*. Good question, but sadly I don't have the answer, apart from this being the only thing standing between me and my undergraduate degree.

Writing a research paper shouldn't be like this. In fact, it's probably NOT like this. But when you combine an undergraduate student who's neck deep in internship projects and challenges, personal projects or other creative pursuits she somehow still decides to continue and a research topic you've never heard of and had no idea at all about. Things can go haywire, as usual.  

So, here's to the unfolding process of my scientific paper draft (it's still a draft. THANK GOD) which happens in the span of 4 - 5 weeks. Let's dive in, you won't believe how chaotic this can be.

---

### Step 1: No thoughts, head empty
The first few days are going to be very-very...confusing and boring. This step is usually filled with you spamming your professor with ideas pitch of research topic you'd want to do (knowing very well it'll be altered and you won't get the actual topic you want). But pitch them anyway. Obviously, ideas don't just come out of nowhere. You'll probably going to spend a lot of time scrolling through Google Scholar or ResearchGate trying to find references, just for starter.

One thing I can say for sure in this step is to, be patient. Be **very very** patient. Of course, this depends on which professor is assigned to be your supervisor, because, different people, different issues. There'll be professors who are going to reply to your chats/emails almost around a week later, worst case-wise. And they're the people who you wouldn't want to rush. (Because they'll hate you for doing it)

After 3 days of just laying on my bed, chatting non-stop with my teammates regarding any new ideas we'd want to pitch and the details (yes, we do this paper in a group format). I finally can enjoy the adrenaline rush when my laptop chimes indicating there's a new inbox in my account. I rushed to my work desk which only takes 3 seconds to get there.

"Research topic decision made for...", it flashes. I couldn't be bothered enough to read the entire title, I immediately clicked the notification and slowly read the content of the email. And surely enough, my smile started to fade too. I leaned back on my chair thinking about how I'm going to break the news to my friends as we hit step 2 --- mass panic.

### Step 2: Panic, anxieties, name 'em
Predictably, my friends were shocked too. Who would've thought that we had to make a hologram game? What the heck is a hologram game and how should we make it? We've never even touched or developed games outside your regular mobile/PC games, so you can only understand how the term 'hologram game' is very foreign and out of this world. It's on the same level with "can't make them" and "impossible".

But, I am excite, really *really* excited. I mean who doesn't? You finally have a clear goal of what you want to build and research on. You can start planning things out, the methods, the references, and actually use them this time. But you're also worried about whether or not you can do this, a lot of negative thoughts flashing in front of you and you start to doubt yourself.

Embrace them.
This step is probably going to be that one moment you'll always remember when you look back at the process. Tell yourself that it's fine to have anxieties, you're new in this field, everyone isn't born ready. But let's not get too deep with that. Because now we have a set of new tasks waiting to get done.

### Step 3: Hoarding documentations and references
In this step, your Dropbox or any cloud service you're using, is probably going to fill up real fast. It's natural, as you start paying attention to the abstract section of your paper, you're going to find yourself 40 tabs deep in Chrome looking for the right journals to be used as references. At this point, your head will probably feel the real pressure of reading pages upon pages of journals. Data and graphs just float by and without you realizing, it's been five hours since you embark on your search and you haven't found anything that suited your topic.

So, I was just sitting there, in front of my laptop. Eyes sore and heavy. Keep glancing back and forth at the clock, knowing that I can't turn back time to start over. This is probably the most unprofessional thing I did, sadly I learned this the hard way as you can see; because I always expect for everything to work out the way I wanted them, I mean, aren't we all? So I just dive head first into google search and didn't bother refining my research topic.

**Always 👏 refine 👏 your 👏 topic 👏**

Just because you finally got your topic doesn't mean it's the finish line of your brainstorm session. Be very specific on which aspect you want to focus on with this topic, what's the scope? Know which things you should and shouldn't put in, analyze which things can be contradictive with the rest of your writings. Because you'll be grateful for this as we continue on to step 4.

## Step 4: All time low
A week has passed since I did the last step. This is the time where it's probably going to be the most boring period of the entire span of 4 weeks planning this out. Just like the title said, all time low.

Because most of the time I always find myself staring at my screen, mindlessly looking up additional references on Google Scholar, typing up structures on how you want to lay your paragraphs out, things you want to write down, etc. Checking back and forth with your teammates, asking for second opinions.

In short, the only thing I'm doing at this point is refine, refine, refine. Find out how to form my train of thoughts into words and paragraphs, plus, how to not make them boring, instead make them look elegant (I hope you kinda get the idea).

Not to mention that, yes, while this entire fiasco is happening, I'm being quarantined at home and yet I still have to check in with my office everyday using Zoom for stand-up meetings. So really, the only thing that will be challenging during this step is whatever my office is going to give me.

## Step 5: Remain calm when things go wrong
Tragedy will strike. It's fine, there's nothing to worry about. Just kidding, please be worried. When something goes wrong, you *definitely* have to do something about it.

> Just a quick disclaimer before we dive in. I really despise Unity engine. It's a great engine. I'll give a standing ovation for the developers and the teams who have worked their asses off to develop this engine. Whoever they are.

> **Except**, it's a terrible engine; and I don't mean it functionality-wise. I mean it UX-wise. It's really painful to use Unity Collab, it crashes almost every week, especially when you're doing heavy changes on the project. Unity Collab somehow seems to have just *given up*. And one single digit difference in your team's editor version can make the entire project deprecated.

So, I was 9 days deep into writing my papers when one of my teammate told me that he has finished working on the camera setting for the holo-game. This is great, I thought. My teammates and I, we're veterans. We've experienced a painfully huge amount of issues working with Unity; so naturally we just don't want to use any Unity services unless we have to (like packages, and such).
