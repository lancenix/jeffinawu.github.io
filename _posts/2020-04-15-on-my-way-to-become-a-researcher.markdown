As a general disclaimer, I have no idea how to write a **good** scientific paper. I have no idea how to do proper research. So it's really predictable for all of you to know that, yes, I'm very much stressed and feeling pressured with the fact that I have a lot of chapters to bullsh\*t through. EXCEPT, I can't really bullsh\*t them. It's an actual paper, after all.

You might be wondering. *Then why??*. Good question, but sadly I don't have the answer, apart from this being the only thing standing between me and my undergraduate degree.

Writing a research paper shouldn't be like this. In fact, it's probably NOT like this. But when you combine an undergraduate student who's neck deep in internship projects and challenges, personal projects or other creative pursuits she somehow still decides to continue and a research topic you've never heard of and had no idea at all about. Things can go haywire, as usual.  

So, here's to the unfolding process of my scientific paper draft (it's still a draft. THANK GOD) which happens in the span of 4 - 5 weeks. Let's dive in.

### Step 1: No Thoughts, Head Empty
The first few days are going to be very-very...confusing and boring. This step is usually filled with you spamming your professor with ideas pitch of research topic you'd want to do (knowing very well it'll be altered and you won't get the actual topic you want). But pitch them anyway. Obviously, ideas don't just come out of nowhere. You'll probably going to spend a lot of time scrolling through Google Scholar or ResearchGate trying to find references, just for starter.

One thing I can say for sure in this step is to, be patient. Be **very very** patient. Of course, this depends on which professor is assigned to be your supervisor, because, different people, different issues. There'll be professors who are going to reply to your chats/emails almost around a week later, worst case-wise.

After 3 days of just laying on my bed, chatting non-stop with my teammates regarding any new ideas we'd want to pitch and the details (yes, we do this paper in a group format). I finally can enjoy the adrenaline rush when my laptop chimes indicating there's a new inbox in my account. I rushed to my work desk which only takes 3 seconds to get there.

"Research topic decision made for..." it flashes. I couldn't be bothered enough to read the entire title, I immediately clicked the notification and slowly read the content of the email. And surely enough, my smile started to fade too. I leaned back on my chair thinking about how I'm going to break the news to my friends as we hit step 2 --- mass panic.

### Step 2: Panic, anxieties, name 'em
Predictably, my friends were shocked too. Who would've thought that we had to make a hologram game? What the heck is a hologram game and how should I find it.
