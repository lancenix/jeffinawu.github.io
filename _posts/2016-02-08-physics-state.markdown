: This is going to be a short one.

After long hours of doing practice PSets and early mornings study sessions, the day finally came.

Today, is results day. Last week I did my first ever olympiad. So happy with what my team achieved. I'm feeling very positive based on the stories and how we felt about the wholesome olympiads experience though it was still city-level. One of my teammates forgot to reset her scientific calculator settings so she spent the first 15 minutes reading through the guides behind the calculator, looking for a way to access the settings menu. 

Essentially there were five essay-like problems given to us, we have exactly 3 hours to try and solve them. I was doing well for the first two problems, then I saw the third problem and realized it was my weakest unit, so I skipped that over thinking I can came back later and finish them but, well, obviously I was wrong. I ran out of time :").

I was pretty sure my teammates will get a spot in the state-level, though I wasn't sure about myself. I was considerably the one with the poorest performance. I missed a problem, I didn't manage to finish the fifth problem due to time running out, so, yeaaa I wasn't going to get my hopes up. 

Then my teacher received an email from the ministry of education with a bunch of lists in pdf files. The final placement for the students who managed to proceed into the state-level. She spent around 10 minutes or so trying to find the right pdf files which titled our state/province. She opened it. 

She then started to read aloud the names of my teammates, assigned 2nd and 3rd place respectively.

"You got 6th."

"I got 6th. What does that mean?"

"Well, you don't get in." She simply replied. "You need to be placed top third to proceed to state."

   You know I really wished I stayed in the maths team.
   
   Wish me luck, until next year.
