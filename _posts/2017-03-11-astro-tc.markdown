Here are lists of the best parts of getting into an Astronomy Olympiad training camp plus some other weird, unimaginable things we did during this low-key depressing times. Enjoy! 

The trainers are very fun people! And this 'weird' challenges support my statement. 

In training camp, we usually woke up around 6AM (though I slept through multiple times) and getting ready for the first period of study session around 8AM. We always have breakfast together in the dining hall, and this is the best time to socialize and get to meet new friends! Because once you got your brain into that 'studying' mode, you'll find yourself unable to communicate with other humans. But that doesn't stop the trainers from asking us to do silly things; for the sake of lighting up the mood of everyone. They're literally the best!

> This is 2020 Jeff redacting: I can't find any pictures from this period though I remember there were a lot of them. It's understandable considering I wasn't really a super aware human being on backing up my pics/data and I got my phone stolen once after this era. Soz.

### 1. Push-Up Challenges ###
Whenever there's a student who fell asleep or at the very least, look sleepy. One of the trainer will ask him to answer questions while doing push ups! Never thought that doing push ups (or any exercise) can actually make you feel more energized, until I got the so-so *unfortunate* opportunity to try it out. It was after we did reviews on synodic periods when my eyes felt very heavy. I decided to close them just for a split second, but me being a dumbass slept through the entire lunch break. 

My friends woke me up with a light shake and then started giggling. I realized what had happened and immediately got up from my chair and settled on my push-up position. The teacher made me do calculations on sky objects' mechanics. Thanks to him, that became my strongest unit.
