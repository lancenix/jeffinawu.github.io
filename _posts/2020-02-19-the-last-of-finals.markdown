I am so happy! But also kind of sad. I guess I could say that I'm overwhelmed by emotions. This is the last finals I'll ever have to do in my undergraduate studies. I'll never have to go back to doing Quizlet and staying late with my friends, video calling together on Discord trying to quiz each other. I'll never have to wake up at 4AM trying to cram in the last bit of information I needed---or at least I think I needed it---into my brain. I'll never have to experience exam anxiety ever again! Woohoo!

But, just like so many things in life will come to an end. And no matter how bad or dreadful those things are, there'll always be a sense of sentiment in there. The sense that, "yeah exam season is awful, but I'm going to miss it now". I'm going to miss the stress-talking before going into the examination room. The confusion and the amount of memes we consumed to keep ourselves sane. The feeling of total breakdown when a project is above the maximum upload size limit. The jokes we told each other just to sooth ourselves down, but really we're shaking inside. Oh, the good old times.

I'm sad because after finals, I'm not going to meet my friends as frequent as usual. They're now have their own thing, I have my own thing and it can be hard at times to find free period that suits all of us, just to come and have a little meet up. In short, we're going to get through the feeling of adulthood and it's really scary---at least for me. We're going to have some hard times adjusting, might even got stressed over tiny things. That's why I told my friends that I'm going to need at least a month to take in and adapting to the changes of my environment.

To recap, my finals went B-Okay. Not feeling really great for a couple of finals. Some of them are like really really mindblowing. 14 questions mixed with theoretical and practical questions, which must be finished in under 100 minutes by the way. Hello, do I look like a machine to you?

There was one exam that got me screaming (literally, not gonna lie). After I leave the examination room with my friend, Andy, we just yelled at each other like "aaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAGHGHGH". That's exactly how crazy and intense the exam was. We kept muttering things like "what the f\*ck was that? What the f\*ck?!!". But then after everything has calmed down  we ate ramen together, so it's all chill, fam. ~~Though it was more like stress-eating than an  actual lunch~~

At this point, I don't really care about my GPA, to be honest. Sh*t happens and you can't hope that it won't happen. Just like what Murphy's Law said: if something can go wrong, it **will** go wrong. (Thanks, Interstellar). As long as it's above the 3.5/4.0 mark, I'm fine. I don't really want to aim for that summa cum laude type of thing (though I'm pretty sure my parents will want that). I mean for me, that sure will be an extra pat on the back for me to have but not really wishing for it that much. So, fingers crossed, however this semester's score is going to turn up, as long as I'm not below my personal standard, it's fine, Jeff. ~~They're not completely wrong about the whole GPA is bullsh*t thing (but not entirely), you know.~~
