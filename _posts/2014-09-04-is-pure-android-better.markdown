Not going to lie, I low-key decided to blind pick on them.

Going into the olympiads have always been my dream ever since I started high school. They're fun, challenging and you get to learn new things your classes won't cover! (Oh and also you'll meet wonderful people!). So when my homeroom teacher told the class that they're going to hold an entrance test for students (especially freshmen) who wants to join the school's olympiad team, I know, I'm up for it. 

### The Entrance Test
I never really know which team I'm going to apply to. But when the school gave out these flyers: listing all of the olympiads teams and the type of tests we need to take for certain olympiad subjects, I realized that physics, computing and maths team are covered by one common exam. So I decided to take on that. 

The test wasn't particulary difficult nor easy as a pie. It was a new kind of examination which I've never experienced but the questions somewhat roughly similar to what you'll call 'logic test'. Thinking it was going to be a lot of maths and calculations, the previous night, I decided to revise an entire year worth of maths and physics materials. Though, I failed miserably and ended up not remembering most of what I learned because I didn't understand them.

Students who decided to take on the entrance test will get dispension from the 'regular' class schedule that day, so we can freely take the test without stressing over the obligation of having to go back to class in an hour or so. My best friend and I decided to take on the same entrance test, I chatted about how crazy I had imagined the test's going to be then we joked about how our school couldn't afford that much intelligence in one exam (boo!). The test lasted for around an hour, with this weird 5 minutes intermission in between the 30 minutes duration because the examiner had to take a bathroom break. 

Weeks later, the names of the students that got selected was announced. They put the list on the school's wall magazine section so everyone can see them. Never really crossed my mind that I'm going to see two of my names, in two different teams. 

### "I Chose You, Pikachu!" But Not Really
The olympiad supervisor/teacher understood how hazy and hard for me to choose between these two teams so he, was kindly enough to give me an extension for three days to think over the decision. He even gave me website references, just to give me a broader picture of what each team will work on in the olympiad. I was really intrigued with maths, not only that the olympiad itself is the most well-known and more famous than other type of olympiads. Thinking that it can open so many opportunities for me in the future, I decided to choose Maths!

The first week of training camp was done after class periods ended. We'd proceed to our designated classrooms, meet with our instructors and other teammates and obviously, study! The maths team can be a little stiff sometimes. Multiple times I want to stab my eye with pencil led because I made a joke and nobody laughed except my instructor. God bless him, he's a pride saviour.

Every week, the instructor will give out PSets (Problem Sets) for the students to work on, and based on these works he will make decisions on who will be eliminated from the team every two week until there were only three of us. 

It was the fourth week of training camp, when I got a revelation. I was watching random movies while doing my english homework, when I stumbled upon a 2014 movie, The Theory of Everything. It was a biography movie about Stephen Hawking. I was so captivated by the movie (ended up crying because the EPILOGUE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD) that I decided that I want to do physics.

It be like that sometimes, and I can be an insufferable student on occasions.

I spoke to my lovely instructor, which he then replied with a huge sigh. My entire defense system was feeling very much alarmed by his response. He then asked me why, and I blatantly told him that there was this amazing movies I watched last night it was about space and there was so many physics in it, I finally had an enlightement on how much applicable physics can be. 

He let me go.

I was really sad to leave the team, though they weren't sad to see me leave(really). I spoke to the physics instructor, which happens to be my physics teacher in class. She said I could join the physics team but I must catch on the previous four PSets she already gave out to the students. If I scored well enough, she'll let me stay in the team. I agreed.

So currently I am in the middle of the fifth week, as I'm writing this (while also trying to work on our current PSet). Happily staying in the physics team. I just thought it would be fun to share this 'changeable' habit of mine and see it in action.
