> Woohoo, look at me, two posts in a week! What a productive moment of my life (lmaoo).

A little background.

I just finished showering and have that one epiphany moment (well, not really). But it feels like there's a door, which finally opened after all this time, though it's ajar.

I have been considering jumping into the realm of artificial intelligence (you know, machine learning and all that fun stuff). But I've never really imagined that it could become a reality (since I majored in Game Development). And I know what you're going to say: "Isn't AI a quite important field in games?". Yeah, you're not wrong about that. AI is used in quite a bunch, and modern games usually have some form of AI (bots, etc.). And I think, because I've been in the realm of game development for quite a long time, things like that don't impress me much anymore. I'm not as excited in developing games as I used to be. I don't know if it's because of me or a third party (you know I do have my own problems regarding my school's curriculum, which I would *very much* want it to be changed).

So since last year, I'd been sorta *lost*. I mean it, I was so lost to the point where I didn't enjoy developing games anymore, I wanted to quit the game industry, I just *didn't* want to touch any of **that** thing.

But I think, something clicked in me that makes me realize all of these hatred towards game development is low-key irrational and too *emo*. I realized that deep down, I still **want** to make games. I want to work at a renown game studio. Be really successful in that field.  I just couldn't quite figure out what went wrong so much that I even had the thought of quitting the field altogether (thank GOD I realized this quite quickly. Soz).

And I think the answer is, a bunch of things. A mixture of things. It's a mix of my disappointment towards my school's curriculum, the disappointment towards my professors, feeling all of the knowledge I learned at class aren't really as useful as I thought they'd be, the lack of support groups which is the result of me alienating myself from my class because I thought I wouldn't continue developing games anymore, so why would I ever need them? So really, if in the future I'd look back at these moments, wishing if only I didn't think about that, if only I follow my passion to create games, who will I have to blame?

Me, myself and I.

(At this point, I'm not sure if this is my TED Talk's script or not)

So now that I've realized this. What's changed? I understand now that blaming the system and nagging at people won't get me anywhere in life, I'd be the same as my annoying neighbor, who's a grandma. I want to keep moving forward, aren't I? I got back to the starting point again, to the drawing board, nourishing my passion for developing games one step at a time. Then out of nowhere I remembered this quote:

> "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life." - Steve Jobs

The thought of me not having to worry where I'll be 10 years in the future is so relieving. I can just follow my passion and let the future decide who I'm going to be. But this doesn't mean that I don't have to have dreams or goals. Somebody once told me to "always start with the end in mind". Always have goals on what you want to be in the end, a game designer? A software engineer? An astronaut? Whoever.

But never, I mean **never**, worried about where you *have* to be next year in order to reach your goal. Just keep focusing on what you *need to do* to get there. Instead of saying, "I'm going to intern at Google next summer", say something like, "I want to become a good software engineer, I realized that getting an internship at Google will be useful".

Throw away the concept of time framing altogether. If you don't get the internship next summer, it's fine, because you've never set that as a goal anyway. But if you think you've done everything in order to get a Google internship but you still didn't get it for three years in a row, that means you haven't done everything.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the future, of what I think I want to be. I'm still searching, so be gentle, bro.

I'm going to make a whole lot of side projects regarding useful things that I really love, that aren't being taught **EVER** by my professors, such as software development, artificial intelligence, AR/VR, UI/UX, etc. Think of it as me catching up with the industry in my own pace. I've decided that in the future I want to be a UI Engineer or a UX Engineer. So I'm going to start learning required knowledge regarding that field through my connections and the internet.

I was also thinking about making this website more useful, so instead of just me posting random and dumbass posts here, I can make logs about my projects (I have a ton of ideas in mind), logs about new things I learned during my time interning at Apple or during my self-learning session.

Seems fun?
