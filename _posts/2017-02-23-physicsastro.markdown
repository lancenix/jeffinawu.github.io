### Re-restarting ###
Senior year is going to begin in less than a week. I'm so not ready to graduate because I feel like I still have a lot of goals that I still haven't achieved in high school. One of them was (at least) getting through to state-level olympiad. So, I insisted on re-taking the entrance exam into the olympiad school team. I was thinking about taking a much more applicable field this year, so more things like computing and astronomy rather than pure sciences. But since astronomy is a relatively new subject for my school, they're going to join the physics team for a while (not to mention the materials are also kind of similar).

Thinking that it'd be fun to try out this new subject which I never realized actually existed on a high school level, I decided to take the entrance exam for the olympiad team. When the result finally came out, I was surprised that there were only three other students that were accepted. Still have no idea why, although I have a couple guesses. 

On the first day of the training camp, we learned about Keppler and a bunch of astronomy jargons. The physics teacher was trying really hard to fill in the gaps for the astronomy team because they currently don't have anyone capable enough to mentor us. 

It was also that day when my homeroom teacher, decided to drag me back to class. You gotta believe me, it was hillarious --and no I wasn't being dragged physically. It was more or less a banter between the physics team teacher versus my homeroom teacher. In the end, she told me that if I failed a subject, she's not going to save my ass. Well, ma'am, I wasn't planning to anyway.

Well, I failed my biology exam (it really is my weakest subject). But, the biology teacher told me that if I got through city-level olympiad for astronomy, she's going to give me a B. A pretty good deal, if I do say so myself. 

Weeks come and go, and it's finally D-Day. Astronomy olympiad is very different than physics. Instead of essay-based questions/problems which usually consist only around 3-5 of them, this one has 30 multiple choice questions and five short essays. Kind of like your usual school exam (except it's astronomy). The exam was also around 3 hours-ish, and this time I'm so happy I didn't run out of time. I managed to answer all of the questions I'm at least 80% sure is right. Because the grading system for this olympiad is a little bit weird: if you're right you got 2 points, if you skip them (no answer) you got 0, if you chose the answer and got it wrong you got a -1. Yea, what a dick move, but I'm not going to take my chances.

Overall, I answered around 25 questions and all of the essay-based questions. With just 3 minutes left I submitted my papers and decided I deserved to treat myself some Snickers.

My teammates were already waiting for me outside the classroom, and we went to Indomaret to buy snacks. We also chatted about the overall experience of cramming the previous night and being overly anxious surrounding the rumour that we weren't going to be allowed to use scientific calculator. It was such a stress-reliever to chat over our common anxieties regarding the olympiad, knowing that there are other people out there who's also experiencing the same feeling as me!

### Results Day And Other Reactions ###
Results Day is always scary. You'll never know what you're going to get. I'm very very anxious especially remembering that I have that little 'deal' with my biology teacher. I have to, I must get through this time. Otherwise I'm going to fail my biology. 

It was a late saturday afternoon, I woke up around 11AM and decided to listen to lound banging music in my room to press on my ever-so-slightly growing anxiety. Since the results came in on Saturday and we have no classes on Saturday except maybe some club activities, the teacher decided that he's going to be the one who'll call us when the results came in. So, obviously, I glared at my phone multiple times like a person with OCD, sitting awkwardly in front of my laptop, fingers fidgeting.

Then the screen flashed multiple times before showing my teacher's contact name. I gulped. This entire dramatization by me, is literally so extra, to the point that I felt like that day was like a college admission results day. I greeted him, and I heard the word '*Congratulations*'.

I didn't really pay attention to the rest, except to the last part when he said that he asked for my email, because he wanted to forward the results to me. I was lost for words. As I hung up the call, I realized a wave of happiness and worries come surging over me. Because, at one side, I'm not going to fail my biology class, but then I'm going to have to skip classes to go to the provincial training camp--somewhere. 

My homeroom teacher is going to be very furious at me for doing this, but I'm not going to step back from an opportunity like this. I told my classmates that I'll be resigning from classes for a while, and all of them were downright concerned thinking that I'll quit school or something (they know how disappointed I am with the entire curriculum anyway). I explained to them, and instead of being concerned they're now low-key mad at me.

*"Are you crazy? What about graduating?" "What about the final projects?" "What are you going to do when Mr/Mrs(...) find out?" "What should we tell Mr/Mrs(...)?"*

Oh, the things I do to get away from these other dreadful subjects. Peace out, be right back in a couple of weeks, suckers. ðŸ˜‚
