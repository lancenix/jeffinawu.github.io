There are many forms of entertainment, now that I have listed all of my favorite TV Shows in a different blog post, I feel kind of obliged to also list my favorite comic books. Though mainly they are Marvel comics, there are some niche comics I read too! Now, I'm not much of a critique when it comes to comic books, as long as they are enjoyable, interesting and have a good narrative flow, I'll consider them good. So, enjoy the list!
