Now if any of you know me in real life, my favorite Avengers will always be the easiest question to answer. It's Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. How exactly I got here is rather a long story, but since I got a blog to mediate it, I'm going to do it. Tracing back into my own timeline. 

Probably not the most anticipated blog post ever, but I'm tired of keep reminding myself (and others) on how I came to like Tony in the first place. So I decided to just blog about it so anyone--including me--can read it whenever.

#### 2009 -- That One Movie Night
I was around 8 years old when my brother asked me to stay up late with him watching the first Iron Man movie because it was being played in this local TV channel. Late here meant that we're going to sleep past 9PM. I agreed to him anyway, though I know I'd probably pass out halfway into the movie.

I brought my pillows and my toys to the living room. Making myself comfortable, because laying on the floor, watching TV for 2 hours or so was an exhaustive task for my 8 year old self, apparently. And yeah, I found it so exhaustive, because 1/3 into the movie I realized that Iron Man is just another version of RoboCop. My brother was crazy about anything mecha back then (he was 11); he loved Transformers, RoboCop, Ultraman, Tamiya and Animal Kaiser(???). 

Knowing this, I wasn't surprised that Iron Man is similar to these types of movies he likes. But I continued watching it anyway until the end, because there's something about this Tony Stark guy that really gives off a different vibe than other characters I've seen in movies that my brother loved to watch.

And no, this is not 'love in the first sight' type of moment because I quickly forgot about it and head to sleep that night, never really thinking about the movie anymore.

#### 2010 -- Accidentally Watched Iron Man 2
Like I said, I quickly forgot that about Iron Man the moment the movie was finished. But, that day, my brother asked my parents if we can go and see this movie called "Iron Man 2" (a pretty lazy-ass name for me back then). Since I never gave it too much thought, I didn't really correlate Tony Stark with Iron Man. I thought Iron Man 2 was just some other mecha-movie my brother loved--not *that* movie which we watched together last year.

So we watched it. I was very much surprised that it starred the same character as the first movie (yeah, what did I know right?). I couldn't describe my feeling, seeing Tony again for the 2nd time. I felt closer to him now that I watched two movies about him. I felt like he's part of this world, but not really--he's fictional. Later I knew that the word I was looking for is: **relatable**. 

I relate to him. His world isn't so different after all compare to my world--except his is being surrounded by a lot of high-tech stuff, then again, he invented those 'stuff'. Although a superhero, he has a human side too. He's human after all. And I think he's the one that first got me excited about STEM. Watching him build an Iron Man suit is somewhat...calming(?). Plus his garage is like every engineers' dream workshop, goddamnit.

#### 2011 -- I Forgot About Him (BuT NoT ReaLly)
After watching Iron Man 2, I think I began liking Marvel movies altogether. I didn't know there was such thing as 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', back then. I just randomly watched any available Marvel movies, related or not: Hulk, X-Men's franchise, The Incredible Hulk, even Tobey's Spider-Man movies. 

Since in 2011 there was no new Marvel movie being released, I decided to take a step back into the origin of Marvel, which is the comics. This is when I began taking interests into a bunch of different Marvel universes/earths; though I just mainly follow around earth-616 and earth-1610. Also, comics are really-really long (timeline-wise) and cover a huge range of characters. So, I'm just going to skip over the time when I read the old 50s and 60s marvel comics (the long-ass 300-ish issues of Iron Man Vol. 1) and straight into the so-so modern era of Marvel comics--the early 2000s.

I think it began with Iron Man Vol. 3 and Avengers Disassembled. It was late at night, around 10PM-ish, when I decided to borrow my dad's laptop to read comics--illegaly.
