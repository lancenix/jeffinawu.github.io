There are many forms of entertainment, now that I have listed all of my favorite TV Shows in a different blog post ([check 'em out](https://starkydev.github.io/2019/09/09/tvshows/ "TV Shows Masterlist")), I feel---sort of---obliged to also list my favorite comic books. Though mainly they are Marvel comics, there are some niche/indie comics I read too! Now, I'm not much of a critique when it comes to comic books, as long as they are enjoyable, interesting and have a good narrative flow, I'll consider them good. So, enjoy the list!

### 1. James Bond : VARGR (2015 - 2016)

I love James Bond. From the books, the old movies until the current Daniel Craig's era. So, naturally I'm interested to read this one--though this comic has a different story arc altogether. The plot is like what you'd expected from a James Bond story. I can say that this series gives a rather different vibe than the movies or the books.

It feels like merging together The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series with the Archer TV Show. It's darker than the current James Bond franchise (Daniel Craig's) and anchored more into the original version of James Bond from the book series. Overall, a cool and quite interesting series to follow. Gotta be honest, I revisited the series once in a while, when I don't have any other good comics to read.

### 2. Civil War II (2016)

I actually hate putting Civil War II in this list--because Carol is such a b*tch in this one, uGH!--but it is one of good events presented by Marvel from Earth-616, to be frank. There's another aspect from this series which I love dearly: the illustration. I love it! How much I love it? Enough to make me follow every social media account the artists have. (Not to mention that Tony is extremely handsome in this one).

Illustration aside, the story writing is also good. The story builds up neatly, always keeping me 'on the edge of the seat', to the point where you could see me slamming my desk--in frustration--after reading the final issue of this series, FOR THE 6TH TIME (OR MAYBE EVEN MORE; I don't remember how many times I've re-read this event).

### 3. Kingsman: The Big Exit (2017)

This one is like that one comic that you can lightly read anywhere, anytime. It covers only one issue, and in that one issue concludes one adventure. It's also set after Brexit happens, so it's fresh and relatable in a way. I love the artstyle, and the story writing in this one. I'd usually pick this up if I ever want a simple intermezzo in between other college activities.

### 4. Man Without Fear (2019)

This one is one of my favorite story arc for Daredevil. Matthew Murdock always takes heavy beatings. But, never have I ever thought that Matt Murdock will be in this condition. And the funny thing is, none of your assumption on who did this to him---is right.

Overall, it's a such a thrilling story. Though if you like action comics, this one lacks a lot of that. Since it focuses mainly on Matt Murdock's character development, so you'll find some heavy drama in there.
