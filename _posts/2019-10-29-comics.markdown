There are many forms of entertainment, now that I have listed all of my favorite TV Shows in a different blog post (go check them out), I feel kind of obliged to also list my favorite comic books. Though mainly they are Marvel comics, there are some niche comics I read too! Now, I'm not much of a critique when it comes to comic books, as long as they are enjoyable, interesting and have a good narrative flow, I'll consider them good. So, enjoy the list!

### 1. James Bond : VARGR (2015 - 2016)

I love James Bond. From the books, the old movies until the current Daniel Craig's version. So, naturally I'm intrigued to read this one--though this comic has a different story arc altogether. The plot is like what you'd expected from a James Bond story. I can say that this series gives a rather different vibe than the movies or the books.

It feels like merging together The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series with the Archer TV Show. It's darker than the current James Bond franchise (Daniel Craig's) and anchored more into the original version of James Bond from the book series. Overall, a cool and quite interesting series to follow. Gotta be honest, I revisited the series once in a while, when I don't have any other good comics to read.

### 2. Civil War II
