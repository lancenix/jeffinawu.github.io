**This post is going to be updated in stages because what will happen here, can stretch out up to 6 months.** Now, although national examinations and other finals are done. I have other matters to take care of, which is: ðŸŒˆ **College Admissions** ðŸŒˆ.

This one type of admission is particularly stressful. I had to constantly look for memes on Instagram just to get my mind off of this a little bit, otherwise my brain's already fried. Because there are just tons of things to handle. I have to write essays (possibly bullshiting my way through) to some international colleges I applied to. I have to fill out forms and this also means photocopying a bunch of certificates, sort them, and then ask teachers for recommendation letters and yadda yadda yadda. Oh and the hardest part: declaring my major.

Currently, I'm interested in pursuing my high-school sweetheart which is Astronomy and Physics or even Mathematics. But I don't want to major in pure sciences, I want them to be more applicable (just how I like it). So I'm also considering engineering majors like Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

I'm shooting my shots to really elite and competitive engineering schools like Stanford, MIT and UC Berkeley (I know I'm a clown). But, let's not get ahead ourselves, I will cancel my admissions if I don't get a scholarship. Because MIT is like $60K / year, and undergrad studies last for 4 years. I only have two kidneys, I can only afford two years with them, at max three.

#### Update: March 25 ####
I got emails from Stanford, MIT and NTU. Truth to be told I wasn't really going to get high hopes over them because they really are elite schools, guys. Let's be real, and I'm an international student, that puts me in a harder position to get in already. I have to really really stand out. So I wasn't really surprised that Stanford and MIT rejected me. Buttt~ NTU asked me if I can take their entrance test. Which means my so-so documents passed through!

#### Update: April 12
I got rejected from NTU. \*SIGHS\*.

And I have completely given up on any of my international college applications because I also didn't get the scholarship from AMINEF. I'm actually still waiting to hear back from UC Berkeley, CalTech and GeorgiaTech. But even if I get in, my family doesn't really have enough money to pay for the tuition. So I'm just going to focus on admitting myself to national colleges. So long MIT, you'll be missed.

My top choices are: University of Indonesia, Bandung Institute of Technology and Binus University. At this point, I have decided that I want to major in Computer Science or any equivalent field. Since they're literally the top colleges for CompSci, it's logical to apply there. With University of Indonesia and ITB, because they're public colleges, I have to go through this standardized college entrance exam, held nationally every year across Indonesia almost simultaneously. Sounds complicated and crazy, I know. I feel that way too.

#### Update: July 20
The results for  the college entrance exam finally came in. Happy to announce that I'll be attending Bandung Institute of Technology! ITB has a different way of declaring major --turns out I don't have to apply specifically for a major, I only have to apply for the school/faculty in which my major will be included. For CompSci that means School of Computer Science and Engineering. Then later in our sophomore year, we can declare our major. I'm already excited to go plus I'm going to attend their campus tour next month on August 9.

Also another background update, I also got accepted into Binus University with 100% scholarship. But, plot twist alert, I decided to declare my major in Game Application and Technology. I'm really excited for this too! --although I haven't made firm choice which one I'll take. We'll see.

#### Update: August 15
I decided to not go to ITB because of personal reasons. I don't really feel comfortable with the environment, people, culture and lifestyle there. And I don't want to spend four years of my life, pursuing a degree in a place that isn't really supportive and I feel like I don't belong. So, heads up everyone, I'm going to Binus!

In fact, as I'm writing this I'm currently going through the 3rd day of their General Orientation. I really like the people here. Although we have our differences, and just like any freshmen we're all a little shy, but I feel like I'm among kindred spirit! That's the most important things, a positive environment that pushes people forward, really progressive!

I think that's all for the updates, readers. I'm currently three weeks deep into my first semester and I'm loving my classes. I'll see you on another post.
