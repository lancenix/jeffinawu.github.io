Whoop, look at me. Haven't really blogged in nearly a year! To be honest, I'm surprised that I still remember that I have this blog lol. But, here I am ready to share some of the craziest and nastiest things that happened during my freshmen year. It has been a wild ride, really. With me trying to balance my academics and social lives while also living the dream --commuting for nearly 2 hours everyday. Wow, sarcasm. So these are some things that I found out about college, some weird and cool experiences I've had.

### 1. 4.0 Doesn't (Quite) Mean Anything. I SWEAR TO GOD
Whoever actually said that you need to get a 4.0 GPA every goddamn semester is either: a) never been into college or b) fails to get a 4.0 gpa in their lifetimes so they persuaded you to get it. (Or maybe even neither, who knows, the universe is a vast space). But, that doesn't mean that you **shouldn't** get a 4.0. It's good if you got 4.0, but don't make your GPA defines who you are. Have a life, bro. 

I have dozens of friends who are aiming for this 4.0 GPA thingy, but they don't really enjoy the #collegelife. They're either always under pressure to be perfect in every class or too scared to try outside class opportunities (game jams, hackathons, etc.) because they're afraid that it might affect their performance in class. It really feels like a rat race. Believe me, been there, done that.

Now this depends on what major you are in. In Computer Science or any related fields, your performance in class won't get you sh*t if you don't have **shining** portofolios, glimmering with cool-as-heck internships, certificates from hackathons/game jams, certificates from programming championship and so on and so on. Computer science is a technical field, so doesn't really matter how good you are in the theoretical classes, if you can't practice it in real life, it's useless. Class credits don't mean sh\*t (unless you have cool, really useful and interesting projects for that class--that can be in your portfolio too!).

So, if you are like me --a compsci/other related field student--go to those hackathons registration forms and participate in (sanely) as many as you can. And don't just aim for participation, aim for the prizes too ðŸ¤‘.
