Whoop, look at me. Haven't really blogged in nearly a year! To be honest, I'm surprised that I still remember that I have this blog lol. But, here I am ready to share some of the craziest and nastiest things that happened during my freshmen year. It has been a wild ride, really. With me trying to balance my academics and social lives while also living the dream --commuting for nearly 2 hours everyday. Wow, sarcasm. So these are some things that I found out about college, some weird and cool experiences I've had.

### 1. 4.0 Doesn't (Quite) Mean Anything. I SWEAR TO GOD
Whoever actually said that you need to get a 4.0 GPA every goddamn semester is either: a) never been into college or b) fails to get a 4.0 gpa in their lifetimes so they persuaded you to get it. (Or maybe even neither, who knows, the universe is a vast space). But, that doesn't mean that you **shouldn't** get a 4.0. It's good if you got 4.0, but don't make your GPA defines who you are. Have a life, bro. 

I have dozens of friends who are aiming for this 4.0 GPA thingy, but they don't really enjoy the #collegelife. They're either always under pressure to be perfect in every class or too scared to try outside class opportunities (game jams, hackathons, etc.) because they're afraid that it might affect their performance in class. It really feels like a rat race. Believe me, been there, done that.

Now this depends on what major you are in. In Computer Science or any related fields, your performance in class won't get you sh*t if you don't have **shining** portofolios, glimmering with cool-as-heck internships, certificates from hackathons/game jams, certificates from programming championship and so on and so on. Computer science is a technical field, so doesn't really matter how good you are in the theoretical classes, if you can't practice it in real life, it's useless. Class credits don't mean sh\*t (unless you have cool, really useful and interesting projects for that class--that can be in your portfolio too!).

So, if you are like me --a compsci/other related field student--go to those hackathons registration forms and participate in (sanely) as many as you can. And don't just aim for participation, aim for the prizes too ðŸ¤‘. ~~Get rich off of it~~

> 2020 Jeff redacting: turns out to get a decent job you need to maintain your GPA at least 3.5/4.0 in where I come from. But please do know that a good GPA can give you an extra upper hand, but whether you get the job or not, that's up to your skills. 

### 2. Find Something Outside Classes You're Passionate About (For Real)
Halfway through my first semester I became bored. Like, really-really bored. It's not that the classes weren't challenging, but everything is just so theoretical and I still don't see what's the use of it except for the "introductory" sake. Thankfully, I didn't drop out of college (I almost decided to, actually). I stayed, but I tried finding other things to keep my mind occupied, such as: Volunteering activites, clubs, studying other fields of computer science which aren't being covered by my major, etc.

This started a chain of reaction. I met a lot of people when I joined and became actively involved in clubs and in volunteering. Apparently, some of the people I know from there are also interested in the same things as I am. So we became good friends. The next thing I remember was us creating a discord channel and a slack workspace for all of us to stay connected and up to date with projects we're working on (if we can help each other). Then, we began attending every developer festivals, jams, talkshows, hackathons together. Some of my close good friends are actually really smart, but don't get intimidated--see that as an opportunity to learn from them!

So, once you have something you like about, find a community (online or offline). Learn and grow from them. It's fun to have companion(s) as you progress!

### 3. Sleep Deprivation Is Cool (But Not Really)
My first game jam was a 72-hour game jam. You know what that means? Aye, living on instant ramen and 30 minutes naps of course. It wasn't the best game jam, to be honest. I learned from that experience that team-picking is very essential to every competition. If your team is not 'fit' enough, you can't--or it'll be hard to--get the best outcome you imagined.
