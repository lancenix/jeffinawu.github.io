Whoop, look at me. Haven't really blogged in nearly a year! To be honest, I'm surprised that I still remember that I have this blog lol. But, here I am ready to share some of the craziest and nastiest things that happened during my freshmen year. It has been a wild ride, really. With me trying to balance my academics and social lives while also living the dream --commuting for nearly 2 hours everyday. Wow, sarcasm. So these are some things that I found out about college, some weird and cool experiences I've had.

### 1. 4.0 Doesn't (Quite) Mean Anything. I SWEAR TO GOD
Whoever actually said that you need to get a 4.0 GPA every goddamn semester is either: a) never been into college or b) fails to get a 4.0 gpa in their lifetimes so they persuaded you to get it. (Or maybe even neither, who knows, the universe is a vast space). But, that doesn't mean that you **shouldn't** get a 4.0. It's good if you got 4.0, but don't make your GPA defines who you are. Have a life, bro.

I have dozens of friends who are aiming for this 4.0 GPA thingy, but they don't really enjoy the #collegelife. They're either always under pressure to be perfect in every class or too scared to try outside class opportunities (game jams, hackathons, etc.) because they're afraid that it might affect their performance in class. It really feels like a rat race. Believe me, been there, done that.

Now this depends on what major you are in. In Computer Science or any related fields, your performance in class won't get you sh*t if you don't have **shining** portofolios, glimmering with cool-as-heck internships, certificates from hackathons/game jams, certificates from programming championship and so on and so on. Computer science is a technical field, so doesn't really matter how good you are in the theoretical classes, if you can't practice it in real life, it's useless. Class credits don't mean sh\*t (unless you have cool, really useful and interesting projects for that class--that can be in your portfolio too!).

So, if you are like me --a compsci/other related field student--go to those hackathons registration forms and participate in (sanely) as many as you can. And don't just aim for participation, aim for the prizes too ü§ë. ~~Get rich off of it~~

> 2020 Jeff redacting: turns out to get a decent job you need to maintain your GPA at least 3.5/4.0 in where I come from. But please do know that a good GPA can give you an extra upper hand, but whether you get the job or not, that's up to your skills.

### 2. Find Something Outside Classes You're Passionate About (For Real)
Halfway through my first semester I became bored. Like, really-really bored. It's not that the classes weren't challenging, but everything is just so theoretical and I still don't see what's the use of it except for the "introductory" sake. Thankfully, I didn't drop out of college (I almost decided to, actually). I stayed, but I tried finding other things to keep my mind occupied, such as: Volunteering activites, clubs, studying other fields of computer science which aren't being covered by my major, etc.

This started a chain of reaction. I met a lot of people when I joined and became actively involved in clubs and in volunteering. Apparently, some of the people I know from there are also interested in the same things as I am. So we became good friends. The next thing I remember was us creating a discord channel and a slack workspace for all of us to stay connected and up to date with projects we're working on (if we can help each other). Then, we began attending every developer festivals, jams, talkshows, hackathons together. Some of my close good friends are actually really smart, but don't get intimidated--see that as an opportunity to learn from them!

So, once you have something you like about, find a community (online or offline). Learn and grow from them. It's fun to have companion(s) as you progress!

### 3. Sleep Deprivation Is Cool (But Not Really)
My first game jam was a 72-hour game jam. You know what that means? Aye, living on instant ramen and 30 minutes naps of course. It wasn't the best game jam, to be honest. I learned from that experience that team-picking is very essential to every competition. If your team is not 'fit' enough, you can't--or it'll be hard to--get the best outcome you imagined. It's like relay racing, if you can imagine. Or basketball, for easy reference.

And because it wasn't the best team I imagined, I had to do extra works. Turned out, I was the only programmer in the team so you can only imagine me coding for nearly 72 hours, non-stop. Not gonna lie, it was my very first brush off with JavaScript so nearly 60% of the time I spent staring, frowning, glaring at my screen--is just to read the documentations or reading answers from Stackoverflow.

I slept only for 2-3 hours for three consecutive days. You know, when you're already in the flow of doing something, you just loose track of time. We got 10th out of 20. Pretty good, if I do say so myself. I came out of that game jam moody, mad (at my team, mostly lol), dazed and thought it was 4PM when in fact it was 6AM. I had a class at 3PM that day (thank the Lord). I got home and slept like a baby until it was 1PM.

I've seen a lot of students pulling off all-nighters and brag about it in the morning while sipping a cup of Starbucks' coffee. It's chique, cool and all. But really, who are we kidding? It's proven to be unhealthy, increases a lot of health risks and you'll end up feeling like a different person altogether (no thoughts, head empty kinda feeling)--which by the way isn't the best mood for learning pretty much anything. So, break up your tasks into chunky pieces, finish those essays earlier, do those PSets, get your sleep. Soon, work-life balance will follow.

~~Why do I sound like a motivation speaker~~

### 4. Getting Close To Your Professors Is Essential
No matter how much you despise your professors. Just, try and act like you care for their classes. Because really, if you don't care about them, they won't give any f about you either. At the bare minimum, nod as an expression that you understand something they were saying, asking a couple of questions (if not frequently), try to take the front row seats and other small little things to get you 'noticed' by the professors. But please don't make a fool of yourself by asking sily questions. At the same time, don't be afraid to ask! If you can't think of a question while class is still in session, ask for your prof's contact and schedule a small Q&A session during office hours.

### 5. Find A Good and Strong Support System
Classes can be tough sometimes, finals and midterms can be very stressful, not to mention those projects that you need to solo-carry for all of your teammates (which is fine as long as they're not part of the burden and you're having fun doing the project).

Although people like to be seen as 'Tough', 'Strong' and 'Independent' --there'll be limits and at times you just want to lay down on bed, stare at the ceiling and probably cry yourself to sleep. Now, now, being dramatic is a necessity at this point, but don't get too far (people might take it the wrong way). Feel a headache coming up? Go buy some Ben & Jerry's. Feeling tired and unenergized? Sleep (or play video games). Grades are important, but so is your mental health.

Never let these depressing feelings piled up inside you. Do I even need to stress you out about how unhealthy that is? Go meet your best friend and talk for hours over coffee or tea. Feeling like you want to cry? Well, probably talk somewhere more private like in your room, their dorms or just through phone calls.

Do anything you feel like will help you feel better! It's all going to work out in the end. üíï

### 6. Peer Pressure Is Real, Don't Let Them Tell You Otherwise
This is what really bothers me the most, but frankly, I never quite understand the feeling I was feeling. Whenever my friends asked me out to hangout, there's always this FOMO feeling creeping up on me.

Afraid that my friends won't ask me out again (ever), because I said 'no' to them once. Afraid that they're going to think that I am this 'uncool' person because I don't like to hang out. And so on...

But when I decided that I'll come with them, I almost always regret it immediately. They go to restaurants that are very expensive--from my point of view. Do understand that I go to a private college, where most of the students came from a wealthy/financially capable families. At this point, it shouldn't be a surprised that they'd go to these kind of places.

My expenses sky-rocketed in the first two months of the first semester. At that time, I know I'm wasting my money on something that could've been a whole lot cheaper. I'm not saying that you should always go with the cheapest. We all know the prices never lie. If you need something that'll last the long run, go with quality, and best quality doesn't come cheap. But I don't want to be left out, so I started buying small things like groceries with the highest price, my stationaries become more pricey and *pricey*.

As their friend, I feel *obliged* to follow their lifestyle to fit in. This is where I was **wrong**. You don't have to. If they don't want to be friends with you because your bags and clothes aren't Gucci, they don't deserve you. It's that simple.

Congratulations for reaching the end of the blog post! I'm currently in the middle of a so-so 'summer break'. A moving car isn't really the best place to type, so sorry if there's any typos or my train of thoughts seems scrambled üòù. Hope you enjoy this post and see you whenever!
