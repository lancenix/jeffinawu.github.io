> ‚ÄúYeah It's on. ‚Äù

They said, high school is going to be the best time of your life. Well, I don't really know what they were doing in high school that can be classified as "fun" but it's sure as hell isn't for me. Ahhh, I'm three months deep into the second semester of freshmen year and I'm already stressed. What's worse is that it doesn't come from the workload. The workload is fine, nothing too crazy, just a bunch of group projects and weeks of adapting into the new school system. But, it's the work/study environment that's really depressing.

A little bit of background, I'm going to graduate in 2 years, with a high school diploma. So, it's not going to be a surprised that the accelerated class is going to be very competitive. It's fun to be competitive **if it's healthy**. Well, this one surely is not. Because we need to survive chugging 3 years worth of classes into a year, a lot of students tend to cheat during exams. I was actually pretty empathetic towards them--the cheaters. I know how much pressure they were getting, since most of them are my friends too, I know how much in deep shit they are (to put it mildly). Not to mention that they *must* pass these classes otherwise they can get 'expelled' from the program.

Then weeks passed by, we survived the midterms. Biology is always my weakest subject ever since Junior High(I'm quite picky in topics when it comes to Biology). Without realizing that finals perios is peeking around the corner, begging me to notice it and start revising. At that time, I was too busy finishing my chemistry class final project: in which I decided to make a short crime/mystery movie surrounding alkanes, butane and propane. Speeding up, it's finally the first day of final week. We have 5 practicals and 7 theoretical exams within that week. Pretty hectic, if I do say so myself. I never managed to sleep below 10PM for that entire week.

The first theoretical exam, History. It went well, though I struggled a lot in the essay sections, I pretty much was able to cover up my ass using complicated words that don't even make sense and probably redundant to make up the one paragraph answer limit. I noticed there were some students cheating using their phones (yes we're allowed to bring our phones into the examination room for some reason (?)) by googling some keywords. The majority of the problems are multiple choice questions, so I bet they aced that one but not the essay üòè.

Second theoretical exam, Biology. I stayed up the previous night trying to remember some weird latin names (which I've totally forgotten about it), and cycles diagrams. Pretty safe to say I felt a little bit bloated by the time I arrived at school after I had my breakfast and my weird sleeping positions only exponentially add the uncomfortable feeling as a whole. The exam was still around two hours, 9AM, so I decided to get some last minute revisions done when I accidentally heard some of the students are plotting to collaboratively cheat. I was like wow, okay, has this gone too far? I asked myself a couple of times. Should I tell somebody or try to advise them against it.

Me, being a coward, decided to not do anything about it. Silently prayed that the teacher will catch them right handed. Somehow, that never happened. It kept happening until it was the last day of finals week, a Friday. It was raining quite hard in the morning, so it's getting colder not to mention that my classroom has, not one, but two ACs (we ended up deciding to not use them, otherwise we'd be freezing.) That day, we had Math and Physics. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious to know how they're going to cheat in this heavily analytical exams. But boy, oh boy, they done it (except for Maths tho, there were questions they were unable to answer).

Long story short, I went to the counsel teacher. Thinking hard on telling her my entire experience of putting up with these people, achieving top scores in classes meanwhile students that I know personally worked hard got a 60, 65 even 40 percent on an exam. So after that mathematics exam, I snitched on them (yeah, call me uncool however you want). But, much to my surprised, the counsel teacher didn't even glance up or at least show some interest to my story, it almost felt like she had heard stories like this **too much**.

I decided to break the one directional communication and asked, "so what are the school going to do about it?"

She gave me a pen and a piece of paper and told me to start writing down names of the students that I know was cheating. I felt powerful and victorious. Finally, I did something right.

But that feeling didn't last long.

A couple of days passed, then I noticed that their behaviors toward me kind of changed (?). So I decided to spill out my curiosity. I asked them what' going on and they replied, "We knew you snitched on us, J". I was like, *yeah, okay, so what are you going to do about it, huh?*. But they just chuckled and continued on their conversation like nothing bad ever happened to them.

Then I found out that the counsel teacher didn't even do anything with their test scores. Didn't even coordinate with the subject teachers to give them a 0 or even make them fail the class. She simply just nagged at these cheaters and then spilled my name by starting her lecture with, "J told me that...".

Yeah, high school is awesome, 10/10 experience, not gonna lie üòÇ.
