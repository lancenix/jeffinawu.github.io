I know I complained a lot about the so-called 'education system' here in my high school. But, there's nothing that can quite beat these crazy things, which I myself don't even believe that they happened, right here, in my high school, during this year's Finals. By the time I'm writing this, finals are over and we're currently in our "summer but not really (since we only have two seasons)" vacation.

#### 1. Examiners On The Phone ####

This is the one that I noticed the most. Teachers as examiners are supposed to be, I don't know, alert? Instead, they be playing Candy Crush on their phones. I mean I don't even care if they watch porn, as long as they (at the very least) gaze their attention, once in a while, at the students (who are explicitly exchanging answers right next to me). ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

#### 2. Examiners Eating ####
I'm in no way agaisnt them if they want to eat. But the most laughable of this all is, "I'm going to have lunch now, but I feel bad if you guys watch me as I eat, so I'm just gonna turn my chair around and eat. I believe you guys won't cheat, right?". In your dreams, Sir. Obviously you know what happened next (this school is goddamn nightmare).

#### 3. Computer Based Exams, But They Don't Understand How To Turn Off The Wi-Fi ####
I mean, the title says it all I guess. It's completely laughable how these people claiming to be "Microsoft Certified" computer teachers but don't know how LAN works. It was a chemistry exam, and my country is in the brink of a new so-called 'digitalized' wave. Where exams are going to be computer-based, students will have portals, etc. I'm actually kind of against the exam one. It's so hard to do an analytical exam, in front of a computer with small desk and no free space to scribble down your calculations because the keyboard's in the way. It's just not a very positive user experience overall. Please stop adopting these new 'requirements' when your school isn't capable enough to sustain it. You'll just be giving us students an extra headache.

#### 4. I Nearly Failed My Maths Exam #### 
Another reason why I'm against this computer-based exam thingy. So I was 20 questions deep into the problem set, when my computer's screen just went blank. It wasn't a blue screen, it just died. I stared blankly at it for a split second before panicking and called the examiner. A little context as to why I was panicking: the web flow which they designed to take these exams are horrendous. If we clicked signed out or quit the browser tab, it means we've finished the exam, so there was no submit button. Our answers aren't being saved in sessions, so if you're 39 questions deep and you refresh the browser, all of your answers are gone. So I'm justifying myself to panic because if the computer had shut down, it means I have been logged out, equals me 'finishing' the exam with only 20 questions out of 30. 

You see where I'm going? Yeah, they couldn't help me, they said it was virus that might've infected the computer, make it throttle so it automatically shut down (I don't know any better, this sounds giberrish for me). So I'm stuck with 66% for my math finals on this semester. I am PISSED üò°.

#### 5. The Ever-So-Changing Exam Time Table ####
