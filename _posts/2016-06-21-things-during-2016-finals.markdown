I know I complained a lot about the so-called 'education system' here in my high school. But, there's nothing that can quite beat these crazy things, which I myself don't even believe that they happened, right here, in my high school, during this year's Finals. By the time I'm writing this, finals are over and we're currently in our "summer but not really (since we only have two seasons)" vacation.

#### 1. Examiners On The Phone ####

This is the one that I noticed the most. Teachers as examiners are supposed to be, I don't know, alert? Instead, they be playing Candy Crush on their phones. I mean I don't even care if they watch porn, as long as they (at the very least) gaze their attention, once in a while, at the students. Because we, are very sensitive regarding our surroundings when it comes to exam period. Glancing back and forth over the examiner. We **know** when is going to be the right time pass answers, to quitely mouthed answers to the person next to us, it's all experience.

#### 2. Examiners Eating ####
I'm in no way agaisnt them if they want to eat. But the most laughable of this all is, "I'm going to have lunch now, but I feel bad if you guys watch me as I eat, so I'm just gonna turn my chair around and eat. I believe you guys won't cheat, right?". In your dreams, Sir.

Majority of the class were either giggling, muttering some words like 'huh? Is he serious?', or just flat out nodded in agreement while saying something so assuring like, 'Yes, Mr. We won't'. If there's any CCTV camera I can stare at (like Jim from The Office) and said "I told you so--" this school is a goddamn nightmare.

#### 3. Computer Based Exams, But They Don't Understand How To Turn Off The Wi-Fi ####
I mean, the title says it all I guess. It's completely laughable how these people claiming to be "Microsoft Certified" computer teachers but don't know how LAN works. It was a chemistry exam, and my country is in the brink of a new so-called 'digitalized' wave. Where exams are going to be computer-based, students will have portals, etc. I'm actually kind of against the exam one. It's so hard to do an analytical exam, in front of a computer with small desk and no free space to scribble down your calculations because the keyboard's in the way. It's just not a very positive user experience overall. Please stop adopting these new 'requirements' when your school isn't capable enough to sustain it. You'll just be giving us students an extra headache.

#### 4. I Nearly Failed My Maths Exam #### 
Another reason why I'm against this computer-based exam thingy. So I was 20 questions deep into the problem set, when my computer's screen just went blank. It wasn't a blue screen, it just died. I stared blankly at it for a split second before panicking and called the examiner. A little context as to why I was panicking: the web flow which they designed to take these exams are horrendous. If we clicked signed out or quit the browser tab, it means we've finished the exam, so there was no submit button. Our answers aren't being saved in sessions, so if you're 39 questions deep and you refresh the browser, all of your answers are gone. So I'm justifying myself to panic because if the computer had shut down, it means I have been logged out, equals me 'finishing' the exam with only 20 questions out of 30. 

You see where I'm going? Yeah, they couldn't help me, they said it was virus that might've infected the computer, make it throttle so it automatically shut down (I don't know any better, this sounds giberrish for me). So I'm stuck with 66% for my math finals on this semester. And maths passing grade is 65%. I am PISSED üò°.

#### 5. The Ever-So-Changing Exam Time Table ####
Now exam timetables aren't really that wonderful. They chugged us with three consecutive exams in one day. Doesn't matter whether it's practicals or theoreticals. But, I do believe that exam timetables have to be something that's concrete, something that all of the students can rely on. So we can plan revisions ahead, be organized and such. Well, not in this imperfect world, it isn't. It was the third day of finals week when my homeroom teacher decided to enter the classroom during our study break/lunch time period. She announced that the school will move every science practical exams (physics, chem and bio) to today, because the labs are going to be under rennovation tomorrow. 

Jaw dropped. Wig snatched. Can't they wait until finals week's over? One of the students asked. 
You know, these teachers when they're being attacked they'd always blame it on someone/somthing. "I was just asked to tell you guys the information. I know nothing about the decision." *Liar*, you're the vice principle of the school. 

We weren't really panicking that much regarding this news. Because we've done our chemistry and physics practicals yesterday, so we only have to worry about biology. But none of us had studied yet. You can only imagine that after the teacher left, we all immediately grouped up to study for this accidental bio practicals. One word for this: *chaotic*.
