I just recently took an interest toward my debating club. I've been inactive this past few months, but I finally got the entire mood and vibe running in my veins again that I am bold enough to turn this into a blog post.

### * Watch "Kurzgesagt" Videos
    [Kurzgesagt](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencealert.com%2Fthis-video-explains-perfectly-why-crispr-really-will-change-humanity-forever&psig=AOvVaw39x3aQTkhF6egzJz7l_W1V&ust=1581191617026000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJji_vybwOcCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD "Kurzgesagt")
    My friends and I are pretty much fans of this channel. They create really cool videos! Full with subtle animation graphics but short and to the point information delivered via voice-over. To the point we'd talked about growing up and making YouTube videos like them. Of course, when we were caught right-handed watching YouTube videos instead of case building the motions, we can simply say that we're doing "research". A valid reason, I'd say.

### * Turn Your Gathering Into A Speech Forum
    It's always fun to see weird ideas and opinions you can get around debaters. We came up with random thoughts at the worst time ever, and sometimes even did random fueled-rage speeches in front of the team like we're going to overthrown the government. So why not facilitate and accomodate what's already been around?
