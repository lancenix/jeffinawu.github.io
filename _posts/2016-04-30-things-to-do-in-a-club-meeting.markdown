I just recently took an interest towards my debating club. I've been inactive these past few months, but I finally got the entire mood and adrenaline of debating running in my veins again that I am bold enough to turn this into a blog post.

### 1. Watch "Kurzgesagt" Videos
![Kurzgesagt](https://i0.wp.com/naibuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kurzgesagt-In-A-Nutshell.png "Kurzgesagt")

My friends and I are pretty much fans of this channel. They create really cool videos! Full with subtle animation graphics but short and to the point information delivered via voice-over. To the point we'd talked about growing up and making YouTube videos like them. Of course, when we were caught right-handed watching YouTube videos instead of case building the motions, we can simply say that we're doing "research". A valid reason, I'd say.

### 2. Turn Your Gathering Into A Speech Forum
It's always fun to see weird ideas and opinions you can get around debaters. We came up with random thoughts at the worst time ever, and sometimes even did random fueled-rage speeches in front of the team like we're going to overthrown the government. So why not facilitate and accomodate what's already been around? Besides, you'll get a compeling environment with people rallying on niche things, like banning religious studies from the curriculum. At least, their goal stays the same, to convince the adjudicators of their validity points, which in this case are the viewers.

### 3. Accidental Movie Club
Reviewing movies can also be a fun and light exercise for critical thinking. Ask them to express their opinions on a certain movie they or all of us have watched and let's hear what the forum said about it! Agree or disagree? It can be any movie you want, pick weird movies, like The Room. An abstraction of regular movies, so the members can be as creative as they want to perceive that movie. Or, if you want to start small for the freshmen, you can start with movies which has clear genres and themes, like cyberpunk, steampunk, sci-fi.

### 4. Watch Cool Debating Videos
You know that feeling everytime you see a cool and hip debater enters a room with their pride as high as the Eiffle Tower and their gaze as intimidating as the fricking bald eagle looking down on you? Yeah, I want to be like that. We've never really done this one but I guess, no one will know what real debating is like until they actually see it. Once they saw it, they can get a sense of the things debaters do, things debaters shouldn't do and what a good debate looks like! And you save yourself a world of pain trying to teach your underclassmen how to debate, when you're too lazy to even demonstrate it. Believe me, debating is an emotional exercise. It can be exhausting sometimes.

### 5. Turn It Into "Conspiracy Theorist Monthly Gathering"
I love surfing into the deep web. Not because I'm looking for something illegal or anything. It's because it's cool, and I'm naturally interested and can be immediately drawn into mysteries. With weird and creepy as hell stories roaming around the surface web about what it is really inside the deep web, how can I resist? Maybe your club members too! Talk about pretty much any conspiracy theories you know and make them compelling (hell even make Google Slides of it), try to convince the audience that your conspiracy theories of choice is actually real. (Illuminati is a real society, I f*cking dare you).
