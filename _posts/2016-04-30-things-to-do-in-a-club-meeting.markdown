I just recently took an interest toward my debating club. I've been inactive this past few months, but I finally got the entire mood and vibe running in my veins again that I am bold enough to turn this into a blog post.

### 1. Watch "Kurzgesagt" Videos

My friends and I are pretty much fans of this channel. They create really cool videos! Full with subtle animation graphics but short and to the point information delivered via voice-over. To the point we'd talked about growing up and making YouTube videos like them. Of course, when we were caught right-handed watching YouTube videos instead of case building the motions, we can simply say that we're doing "research". A valid reason, I'd say.

### 2. Turn Your Gathering Into A Speech Forum
It's always fun to see weird ideas and opinions you can get around debaters. We came up with random thoughts at the worst time ever, and sometimes even did random fueled-rage speeches in front of the team like we're going to overthrown the government. So why not facilitate and accomodate what's already been around? Besides, you'll get a compeling environment with people rallying on niche things, like banning religious studies from the curriculum. At least, they're trying to convinve the adjudicators, which in this case works as the viewers.

### 3. Accidental Movie Club
Reviewing movies can also be a fun and light exercise for critical thinking. Ask them to express their opinions on a certain movie they or all of us have watched and let's hear what the forum said about it! Agree or disagree? It can be any movie you want, pick weird movies, like The Room. An abstraction of regular movies, so the members can be as creative as they want to perceive that movie. I'd recommend something that's more specific, like cyberpunks and then confront the ethics in a game/technology-drive applications.
