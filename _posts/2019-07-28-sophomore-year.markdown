Is this blog going to get annually updated or what? I have no idea. But, sophomore year is done, and I finally got the time to update. Woohoo! Since, I finally have a (quite) rigid platform to share and blog about things now (this blog, this url--right here), I can also start sharing other things not just about my college life but also other things like my projects! So you can get to know what projects I'm currently doing or have done (I have no idea, maybe you're interested in that (?)).

All in all, I'd say that this year is that **one** very chaotic year. Classes were hard as hell, the professors also weren't being helpful either, I had tons of freelance project piling up, competitions lining up, and in the midst of it all, I got an elightment for my future--becoming a researcher (told you, very chaotic).

### 1. Labs Are A New Type of Hell
Now, I've had labs before my sophomore year, but this year's labs are pretty much come as a shock. Labs in my freshmen year were very chill: no projects, no challenges, not even a PSet, just study sessions. So when this year's labs got me 5 projects (one of them wants us to submit a Devlog every week), I was *shooketh*. In other words, I was overwhelmed. Some of these projects are also quite mindblowing--scale-wise.

Create your first game with a unique mechanic, make a storyboard, and an artbook, participate in ICPC and must successfully answer at least one question, and a bunch of other things. At that moment, I realized, this is what college really is like. Freshmen year is just a facade.

### 2. Study Groups Are Really F*cking Important
If I remember correctly, I said something about finding your passion outside classes and join their communities. This is also true for classes. Befriend anyone who understands the materials well, motivated to learn them, pay attention for the entire class sessions, and so on. Because when it's exam periods, you'd want to have someone competence enough to back you up if you have any questions.

I usually have different study groups for each class. This is actually really cool, because I get to teach my study friends who aren't in my study group for a certain class and we can all learn from each other! Exchanging informations, PSets (typically different professors will give different PSets) so we get to have more study resources!

### 3. Time Management
Apparently, I never really appreciated the time management skill I honed since high school up until this point. I used to be so organized; my bullet journal would always be colorful and filled with checked to-do lists. Ever since college, I never really got into the grind of bullet-journaling again, because I don't have time to make things pretty and at times I forgot to update my to-do list.

Then I realized that I don't really need bullet journal that much (not that I'm saying you shouldn't do bullet-journalling). Years of practicing time management using this method has somehow put my brain in autopilot mode. It just automatically updates me with things I have to do for that day, how many hours I should put into a certain task and an overview of what my day look like--planning ahead.

It becomes so useful when you have 5 projects due at the same week, with exams looming around, competitions' projects waiting to be finished and lots of other demanding club activities (meetings, project planning, paperworks, etc).

### 4. Study Hard, But Take Timeouts
A lot of people prefer to have study breaks, but I personally can't live with the guilty feeling of 'abandoning' my studies when I haven't really master the materials. So I always have a study period: I'd study for 8 hours (let's say because I have an exam tomorrow, I don't usually study that long on daily basis lols), then I'll have 2 hours of study break, just doing mundane things (updating my journal, eat, reading one chapter of a book, etc.).

But, before I go into my study break period, I want to take 30 minutes to review everything I have learned during my study period, making sure I understand everything before I chill. If I hit walls or anything on a certain material, I'll mark it and then study them on my next study session!

Whatever your method is, taking breaks is important. Just like a computer, your brain needs rest. It can't run 24/7 without performance loss. That's why a lot of people on the internet always say things like "Study smart, not hard". The longer you study != the quality of your studying.

A few lessons from this year's recap: once you got the thrill of it all, college is fun. Like, really *really* fun. Projects not going well and tomorrow is the deadline? Do whatever you can on it right now, give your best shot, right now and hope for the best then let it go, you've done what you can--just remember to assess the reason your projects turns out that way and learn from your mistakes. After you crushed one hard-as-hell exam? Go eat Ramen or hang out with your friends. You deserved it.

Things will always feel better in the end. Knowing that you're (finally) free from projects, classes, boring lab sessions. But the best feeling is always knowing that your projects and classes you worked your ass off for such a long time, through sheer chaos, have finally come to fruition. :D
