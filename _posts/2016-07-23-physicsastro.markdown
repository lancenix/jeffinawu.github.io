Senior year is going to begin in less than a week. I'm so not ready to graduate because I feel like I still have a lot of goals that I still haven't achieved in high school. One of them was (at least) getting through to state-level olympiad. So, I insisted on re-taking the entrance exam into the olympiad school team. I was thinking about taking a much more applicable field this year, so more things like computing and astronomy rather than pure sciences. But since astronomy is a relatively new subject for my school, they're going to join the physics team for a while (not to mention the materials are also kind of similar).

Thinking that it'd be fun to try out this new subject which I never realized actually existed on a high school level, I decided to take the entrance exam for the olympiad team. When the result finally came out, I was surprised that there were only three other students that were accepted. Still have no idea why, although I have a couple guesses. 

On the first day of the training camp, we learned about Keppler and a bunch of astronomy jargons. The physics teacher was trying really hard to fill in the gaps for the astronomy team because they currently don't have anyone capable enough to mentor us. 

It was also that day when my homeroom teacher, decided to drag me back to class. You gotta believe me, it was hillarious and no I wasn't being dragged physically. It was more or less a banter between the physics team teacher versus my homeroom teacher. In the end, she told me that if I failed a subject, she's not going to save my ass. Well, ma'am, I wasn't planning to anyway.

Not going to lie I failed my biology exam (it really is my weakest subject). But, the biology teacher told me that if I got through city-level olympiad for astronomy, she's going to give me a B. A pretty good deal, if I say so myself. 

Weeks come and go, and it's finally
