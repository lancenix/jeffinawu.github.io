Well this is a different type of post altogether. Ever since college started, classes aren't always exactly 7 - 5. I always have some free time here and there, squeezed in between classes. I spent most of them watching cool shows which either: a) I accidentally stumbled upon them or b) I actually like them. Here's a list (not in any particular order) of TV-Shows which I craved a lot:

(Beware: things might get long and weird at times)

### 1. Hannibal NBC (2013 - 2015)

I don't really know how much Hannibal TV Shows out there, but to avoid confusion, I'm still going to clarify that it's NBC's Hannibal. It's everything I love in one show: hot men (woohoo), compelling characters, mysteries, killings (not saying that I love killing) and obviously superbly written stories!

I started watching this because I started reading Thomas Harris in high school. I know about Hannibal because of Anthony Hopkins' legendary performance, other than that, I know absolutely nothing about who Hannibal is except the fact that --well, he is a cannibal. Reading the books give me deeper insights on who he is, without me realizing I started liking his character arc. Then my friends on Tumblr started telling me about this one show I have to watch if I love Hannibal. Ta daa~

### 2. Sherlock BBC (2010 - 2017)

This show is the reason why I know and love Benedict Cumberbatch. Back then in 2010, internet is something that's a luxury to have. Since my parents are those type of boomers who always see technology as a bad influence (because my brother and I love gaming too much), we didn't really have proper internet connection until around 2013. 

I discovered social media that year, and so I became connected with friends all over the world through Twitter. I met people with the same interests as I am, it's honestly so cool! Soon a lot of my internet friends told me to watch Sherlock BBC. I was really skeptical at first, because I'm a huge fan of Doyle's version of Sherlock Holmes and what BBC did in this show are basically breaking the barriers. 

But I gave it a try anyway and look at where I am now

### 3. Peaky Blinders (2013 - Present)

Gonna be real honest, I don't really like this show when I first watched it back in 2013. Maybe, my likeness towards crime drama hadn't really peaked back then. But, I revisited Peaky Blinders some time around 2016 and I'm loving it! They have really compeling characters, and the directing is really good too.

At that time, I was really sure that, if given the chance, I can run a 1910s gangster-family business because of this show. 

~~P.S. I LOVE THOMAS SO MUCH IT HURTS~~

### 4. Rick And Morty (2013 - Present)

Well, this one, really is something. I watched the show because around 2015, it somehow becomes really popular. Suddenly people are talking about it (probably because of the weird and low-key crazy fans). So I gave it a shot too, and I FREAKING LOVE IT. 

Partially because Rick and Morty's adventures are really just full of surprises, so you're always going to see weird-ass things that just blows your mind. Really proves that the writers are really good at world-building!

### 5. Mindhunter (2017 - Present)
