It's not surprising that although we've never actually had proper training in debating, we somewhat become aware of what a good debate is and how we **should*** debate --just by watching a bunch of national debating competitions through YouTube. Sometimes we even try doing reenactment of certain participants whom stood out from the 'video sessions' (and possibly make jokes about them).

It was a couple of days after midterms when our debating teacher decide to show up with a piece of paper, while panting. It appears she had been running from the teachers' room to the second floor in a matter of seconds. "We got an invitation."

This could mean two things:

1) There's another school out there who wants to 'challenge' us on a debate session.
2) There's a debating training camp somewhere nearby and the organizer wants us to come.

It was neither. She then proceeded to read the contents of the paper aloud as we scrambled around her, leaving whatever mess we were doing. Words like "PSDC" came out of her mouth along with "2 weeks long" and "in Anyer".

My seniors started jumping in excitement, grabbing onto each other. Meanwhile my friends and I are in complete darkness of what those words mean. So I started blasting them with questions, "What's a PSDC?" and "who's gonna go?"

After the entire thrill had died down, my seniors sat down and decided to make the rest of the club gathering sessions become a seminar for newbies. They explained that just like olympiads, debating also has national championship. The roadmap is similar to olympiads, whoever came on top three during city-level championship can proceed to the provincial, then after that the nationals. Overall, what this invitation means is that we got to be in the provincial-level with invitations, so we don't have to win that top-three position in the city-level championship. 

I was wowed, to be honest. I didn't know that my seniors have *that much* winning streaks to the point where the Ministry of Education knows that. Then my seniors decided to step down from the main roster, because they [have been there, have done that]. They think that it'd be best if they let the juniors take the spotlight this year. It's honestly so heart-wrenching because I know deep down, they want to go, and they can, but they won't.

It is crazy how basic things salty people do like getting into an argument can really take a toll on someone's sanity. I finished classes around 5PM, usually it's already quite dark outside and the entire school will be emptied out for the next 30 minutes because they need to close down the school at 7PM. My class is always known to be the last class standing, we finished classes so late, that at one point the janitor had to wait in front of our classroom like a security guard, pouting.
