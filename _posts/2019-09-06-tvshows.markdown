Well this is a different type of post altogether. Ever since college started, classes aren't always exactly 7 - 5. I always have some free time here and there, squeezed in between classes. Those are the perfect time to also squeeze in one or two episodes of my favorite show!

So, here's a list (not in any particular order) of TV-Shows which I craved a lot. Because I want to always remember them (or put them in a list, in this case) so I can have some angsty nostalgia, 20 years in the future:

(Beware: things might get long and weird)

### Currently Watching
There are shows which currently still in progress of me finishing it, so I can't really say anything or even review about it. But those who show great promises for me, I'll list them here:
* Barry (2018 - Present)
* Outlander (2014 - Present)
* The Witcher (2019 - Present)
* Stranger Things (2016 - Present) ~~I know I'm late to the party~~
* Ozark (2017 - Present)

Alright, on board with the masterlist!

### 1. Hannibal NBC (2013 - 2015)

![NBC Hannibal](/img/in-post/tv-shows/hannibal.jpg)

I don't really know how many Hannibal TV Shows out there, but to avoid confusion, I'm still going to clarify that it's NBC's Hannibal. It's everything I love in one show: hot men (woohoo), compelling characters, mysteries, killings (not saying that I love killing) and --obviously--superbly written stories! ~~Did I mention romantic attraction between main characters?~~

I started watching this because I began reading Thomas Harris during high school. I know a tiny bit about Hannibal because of Anthony Hopkins' legendary performance, other than that, I know absolutely nothing about who Hannibal is except the fact that --well, he is a cannibal. Reading the books have given me deeper insights on who he is, and without me realizing--I started liking his character arc. Then my friends on Tumblr started encouraging me to watch this version of Hannibal. Boy, oh boy, I do love it.

Though the show had ended, I still re-watched this masterpiece over and over. It never stops to amaze me.

### 2. Sherlock BBC (2010 - 2017)

![Sherlock BBC](/img/in-post/tv-shows/sherlock.jpg)

This show was the reason how I know and come to love Benedict Cumberbatch. Back then, in 2010, internet was something luxurious. Since my parents are those type of boomers who always see technology as something bad (because my brother and I love gaming too much), we didn't really have proper internet connection until around 2013.

I discovered social media that year, and so I became connected with friends all over the world through Twitter. Soon, a lot of my internet friends told me to watch Sherlock BBC. I was really skeptical at first, because I'm a huge fan of Doyle's version of Sherlock Holmes and what BBC did to this version are basically breaking the barriers.

But I gave it a try anyway---and look at where I am now. When they ended the show in 2017 with its 4th season, I was devastated. I love this show so much I actually streamed BBC at 2AM WIB (though it was school night). The things I do for Sherlock.

### 3. Peaky Blinders (2013 - Present)

![Peaky Blinders](/img/in-post/tv-shows/peaky-blinders.jpg)

Gonna be real honest, I didn't really like this show when I first watched it back in 2013. Maybe, my likeness towards crime drama hadn't really peaked back then. But, I revisited Peaky Blinders some time around 2016 and now I'm onboard with their ship! They have really compeling characters, and unique directing too! There are moments that just felt so close and relatable to me but not really(because my family doesn't run an illegal business, duh).

The world building wowed me so much too, and coincidental enough, I was really into Sherlock BBC at that time. Looking back at what 1910s/1920s England looked like, really gives off Doyle's Sherlock vibe--which I missed a lot, since Sherlock BBC is way more anchored into the modern world.

Overall though, I really like the fact that there's always going to be lots of surprising turns of events in the show. And their good character writing helps a lot in creating better characters' arcs, hence making the show more intriguing and fun to follow than ever.

~~P.S. I LOVE CILLIAN MURPHY SO MUCH. HELP~~

### 4. Rick And Morty (2013 - Present)

![Rick And Morty](/img/in-post/tv-shows/rickmorty.jpg)

Well, this one, really is something. The reason I watched the show was because: around 2015, it somehow became really popular (?). Suddenly people were talking about it (probably because of their weird and low-key crazy fans). So I gave it a shot too, and boohoo, I'm part of the fandom now.

Rick and Morty's adventures are really just full of surprises, so you're always going to see a lot of weird-ass things that just blows your mind. Really proves that the writers are really good at world-building! Not to mention that it's funny--though sometimes it gets deep; even goes f*cking **meta**--and easy to follow. Also, I consider myself a nerd for sci-fi things. So when there's a show specifically about sci-fi like this, I'm naturally attracted to it!

### 5. Mindhunter (2017 - Present)

![Mindhunter](/img/in-post/tv-shows/mindhunter.jpg)

David Fincher is one of my favorite directors. I consider him one of the best mystery/crime/thriller directors. So when I heard that he's going to direct some episodes of Mindhunter, I became curious about what Mindhunter is. Turns out, it's the real life version of Hannibal NBC. HAHAHA.

No, for real, the story is about two FBI agents (Holden and Bill). You could say that, they're two of the key players who enabled FBI's Behavioural Science Unit (BSU) to be established in the first place; and surprise-surprise, Will Graham (from Hannibal NBC) is also from BSU.

Exactly what do they do in BSU? They're investigating criminals' train of thought, and it goes so much deeper than just that. It's thrilling and bone-chilling to see them investigating murderers, rapers, etc. See what things they can dig out to *understand* more of why these criminals did what they did--and how their findings affect people's understandings toward crime-leading tendencies. Plus, I always love shows surrounding criminal psychology. :D

### 6. Altered Carbon (2018 - Present)

![Altered Carbon](/img/in-post/tv-shows/alteredcarbon.jpg)

Like I said, I'm a huge nerd for Sci-Fi stuff. Altered Carbon is one of those Netflix shows that you just stumbled upon and then you thought, 'hmm, it's pretty good'. So I added it on the list; though I found myself bored a couple of times in the middle of season 1; but Anthony Mackie is going on board for Season 2 as Takeshi, so I'm excited to see how it'll turn out!

I'd say, if you love things like Blade Runner 2049, Ghost In The Shell, you'll like the vibe this show's giving you. It has a really unique, low-key weird and crazy main plot (like any cyberpunk stories). Plus, the cyberpunk world building is pretty good too (though the VFX aren't really that *juicy*---if you know what I mean).

### 7. The Young Pope (2016) / The New Pope (2020)

![The Young Pope](/img/in-post/tv-shows/theyoungpope.jpg)

This one is just...aghh!! Very controversial. But, at least Sorrentino's back at it again with another unique and one of a kind directing. I want to say that I love this, but then my religious parents might *whip* me with a belt. Because this show cannot be enjoyed by someone who's strictly religious (like my parents). There are so many controversial, out of the box things that they did in the show which will make your brain goes: "?????". So, you really do need an open mind (a very open one) to watch this, enjoy and not get salty on things(it's a fictional work, dumbass. Get over it).

Obviously this show is heavy-loaded with a lot of Catholic's cultures, rituals, and christianity teachings. But I guess the show is trying to present us how these really ancient wisdoms hold up in our modern world and current society through scenarios/events that happened within the show. Again, I repeat: you need to be at least a chill-but-religious christian to enjoy the show. Believe me, I accidentally made my dad watched *a fraction* of one episode and he immediately left while shaking his head in disagreement.

### 8. Person Of Interest (2011 - 2016)

![Person Of Interest](/img/in-post/tv-shows/poi.jpg)

Gotta be honest, this show is what got me interested into programming and computer science in the first place. Not that I instantly started coding after watching this, but it was the first time I saw programming as something *cool* and useful instead of something that's abstract, nerdy and out of my world. Kudos to J.J. Abrams and the writers for ending this show with a really good, acceptable and **respectable** final act, not like some finales (eyeing on you, Avengers: Endgame and Game of Thrones).

This show is really rich with good character arcs and plot-twists. Obviously, wouldn't be effective if they don't have a strong main plot in the first place. It merged the danger and the power of computer programs/cyber security in a very beautiful way. People without programming background can easily understand the consequences of each events related to the main plot without getting into too much technical details.

The story follows a man named Harold (the cinnamon roll), who's a genius programmer working on and with a program we referred throughout the show as 'The Machine'. The Machine 'spits out' social security numbers of people who can be either victims or perpetrators of a crime that day. We won't know until John (the anime-dad starter pack), an ex-CIA agent---who's also presumed dead by the entire world, hired by Harold---investigates these numbers: are they the victims or the perpetrators? Sounds hella simple, until your main characters got tangled with the mafia, secret organizations even the government hunting them down to steal The Machine. (God, I'm spoiling too much things, aren't I?).

### 9. Silicon Valley (2014 - 2019)

![](/img/in-post/tv-shows/silliconvalley.jpg)
Probably one of the geekiest show I've watched. Though sometimes my friends think that it's too "stereotype-ish" towards programmers, I find it rather funny. It's fun and (high-key) inspiring to see a group of programmers, who are rather diversed---I'd say, trying to start a company (at this point I'm imagining me and my gang doing this).

There are some ups and downs in the series though, like any series. And the plot might get confusing at times. But overall, a good amount of fiction is there, and still grounded on the harsh reality of tech-industry (which is such a brave thing to do).

### 10. Mr. Robot (2015 - 2019)

![](/img/in-post/tv-shows/mrrobot.jpg)
If you like the 2019 Joker's vibe, but you somehow want lots of hacking scenes, then this show is exactly that. I found myself crying and laughing (yes, at the same time) watching the finale---though it might just be me, being very dramatic. They built Elliot's character arc so good, so when they ended the show it feels like you just lost a connection. Does that make any sense?

This show probably started and formed the so-so 'movement' of the 'dark' hackers' aesthetic, which currently taking over every single hacker-wannabe social media profiles. They'd use 'mysterious' names or something and then used some quotes from Mr. Robot as their bio. Put on 'dark' pictures/scenes from the series as their profile picture. Is it just me experiencing this? I swear a lot of my college's Cyber Security major freshmen's github profiles look like this.

Another thing, why I think Mr. Robot is cool: because although it's set on a fictional world, a lot of things are actually based on our world, our current political situation and such. FSociety is just another name of Anonymous. E-Corp is based on Enron---at least I believe so (which was famous for its scandals---inside trading, misleading financials etc). Because of that it's relatable, and relatability is good in tv shows. Personally, I won't watch a TV show with no level of relatability whatsoever (in the stories, characters, etc.).

### 11. Westworld (2016 - Present)

![](/img/in-post/tv-shows/westworld.jpg)

This is one of the most shocking tv shows I've ever watched. I never thought this series is about robots and artificial intelligence, low-key vibing Ex Machina. But hey, who thought? To be honest, I watched this series because Anthony Hopkins is in it (I'm a big fan of him ever since Hannibal---yeah, lol).

If you like steampunk stuff, with a little bit of an ex-machina vibe. This show is for you. Really cool drama and tensions going on in the show, yet it's simple enough for people who are not really into AI vs People thing to understand.

### 12. True Detective (2014 - Present)

![](/img/in-post/tv-shows/truedetective.jpg)
Another crime show! Surprise, surprise. To be honest, back in the days around 2015-ish, I always mistakenly thought that Matthew McConaughey is Cillian Murphy and vice versa. Not only that, I just learned last month the difference between Matt Damon and Brad Pitt. So really, if there's anyone whom I should be mad at, it's myself.

This show is just like any other crime shows really, if you want to be frank. But, it's more close to Mindhunter than to CSI (lmaoo, really). Matt's character; Cohle is like this super interesting detective. I relate to him in the first scene right away. Do you know how rare that is? Yeah, so rare that the only other character that has 'that' thing with me is Tony Stark, so far.

Cohle is always very intuitive when it comes to solving cases. Like Will Graham in Hannibal except Cohle doesn't know anything about criminal psychology. So instead, Cohle would track down little things, details or patterns that exist between the evidences, and find out what they mean and how significant they are for the case. And those 'little things' can take him into so many 'realms': from narcos to an illegal cult in a remote desert.

That's all I have for the list! Have fun discovering my favorite shows which can possibly be your next favorite too. I might add new shows as I go along because frankly, I don't really remember how much shows I love since most of them are finished already. Cheers!
